<h2>About:</h2>
<p>First off I'll say that I am a tech enthusiast. I like to watch videos and read articles about technology. I mainly keep up with personal computer tech. I've built my own personal computer back in 2016 and I continue to upgrade it as the years go by. I also like watching anime. My favorite anime is One Piece. It's one of the longest running anime's that I take pride in saying I'm caught up with it. As for my beliefs, I am a Christian. I do my best to live by what Jesus said in Matthew 22:37-40</p>
